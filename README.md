# 2022 Project Summit Unconference Planning 

*More details coming soon.*

To propose a topic:

1. See if it is already listed in https://github.com/numfocus/summit2022-unconference/issues .
2. If not, open a new GitHub issue.

During the actual summit, we will be using a physical whiteboard for final scheduling
and room assignments. This repository is only to propose ideas.

Thank you for your participation!
